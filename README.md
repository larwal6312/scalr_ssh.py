# scalr_ssh.py
Needs to be rewritten, but hey it works:

Scirpt to use the scalr API command line tool to dynamically find a farm, farm role, and IP and ssh you into the server.

You will need to first install scalr-ctl command line tools. At the time of writting the rest API did not have all the same features as the command line tool.

Instructions to install scaler-ctl can be found here:  https://pypi.org/project/scalr-ctl/
